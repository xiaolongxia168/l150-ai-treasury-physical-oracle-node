# Workspace Backup Log - 2026-02-13 00:04

## Backup Status: ✅ SUCCESS

### Repositories Backed Up

1. **l150-api** (nested repo in `api/` directory)
   - Commit: a7d681a - chore: add gitignore for node_modules
   - Pushed to: https://github.com/xiaolongxia168/l150-api.git
   - Action: Added .gitignore to exclude node_modules, cleaned up staged files

2. **workspace** (main repo)
   - Commit: 33071f8 - backup: 2026-02-13 00:04:01 - update api submodule ref
   - Pushed to: https://github.com/xiaolongxia168/l150-ai-treasury-physical-oracle-node.git
   - Action: Removed api directory from tracking (it's a separate repo)

### Notes
- The `api` directory is a nested git repository and is now properly managed separately
- Future backups will handle both repos independently
- Both repos now have upstream tracking configured for easier future pushes

### Next Backup
Scheduled via cron job (workspace-backup)
