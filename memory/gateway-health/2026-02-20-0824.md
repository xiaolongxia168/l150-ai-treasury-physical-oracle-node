## Status Summary
| Metric | Status | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Gateway Process | ✅ Running | PID 17961 |
| RPC Probe | ✅ OK | ws://127.0.0.1:18789 |
| Port 18789 | ✅ Listening | 127.0.0.1:18789 |
| Service State | ✅ Active | LaunchAgent loaded |

## Resource Usage
| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| CPU | 0.0% (current) / 137.9% (peak) | Normal now, spike earlier |
| Memory | 7.6 GB (7,879M) | ⚠️ Elevated |
| Compressed Memory | 1.4 GB (1,410M) | - |
| Uptime | 04:55:30 | Running since 12:55 AM |
| Threads | 23 | Normal |
| Ports | 81 | Normal |

## Observations
- Gateway is stable and responsive
- CPU spike to 137.9% was observed but has returned to idle
- Memory usage at 7.6 GB is elevated compared to typical 3-4 GB baseline
- Compressed memory indicates system is managing pressure

## Actions Taken
- ✅ Status verified via `openclaw gateway status`
- ✅ Port 18789 confirmed listening
- ✅ No restart required (gateway running normally)

## Recommendations
1. Monitor memory trend - if consistently >8GB, consider scheduled restart
2. High CPU spike pattern suggests periodic intensive tasks (cron jobs)
3. Next check: 08:54 AM (30 min interval)

## History
- Last check: 2026-02-20 07:54 AM
- Trend: Stable with periodic CPU spikes
