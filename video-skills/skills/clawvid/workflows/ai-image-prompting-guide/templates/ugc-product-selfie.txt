Photorealistic selfie of a young [ETHNICITY] woman, early 20s, [HAIR DESCRIPTION], taking a bathroom mirror selfie.

She's excitedly holding [PRODUCT] next to her face with a genuine smile. Wearing [CASUAL OUTFIT].

Natural morning light from window. Bathroom setting with white tiles.

Shot on iPhone, authentic social media aesthetic.

PRO TIPS:
---------
• Add "slight imperfections" to avoid uncanny valley
• "Shot on iPhone" cue helps with authentic social media look
• Include environment details (steam, messy counter, etc.)
• Expression should be mid-action (mid-laugh, squinting from smile)
