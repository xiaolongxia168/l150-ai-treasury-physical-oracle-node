The tunnel mouth is a dark semicircular void in the hillside, unnaturally dark inside as if light cannot penetrate past the threshold. Foreground: a weathered wooden torii gate at the start of the path, faded red paint almost completely worn to bare grey wood, a chain with a rusted padlock and a hand-painted sign in Japanese characters hanging across it reading warning. Mid-ground: cracked asphalt road leading straight to the tunnel entrance, weeds and ferns growing through the cracks, puddles of rainwater reflecting the grey sky. To the left a small moss-covered stone jizo statue with a faded red cloth bib, offerings of wilted flowers at its base. Background: the tunnel entrance itself is the focal point, perfectly centered, the concrete facade stained with dark water streaks and patches of green-black mold, rebar exposed at the top where concrete has crumbled away. Dense cedar forest frames both sides, branches reaching inward as if pointing toward the entrance. Overcast diffused lighting from above, no direct sunlight, the tunnel interior is pure black void. Dark cel-shaded horror anime style, muted desaturated palette of forest greens concrete greys and the faded red of the torii, 8K detail, visible texture on every surface",

A drainage channel runs along the right wall, dark water flowing in the wrong direction deeper into the tunnel instead of out.

A few personal items are embedded in cracks in the wall, a rusted watch, a faded photograph too water-damaged to identify, a hair clip.

Her mouth is curved in a smile that is too wide, stretching past where a human smile should end, showing teeth. Her skin is the pale grey-blue of someone long dead. She stands perfectly still but the water around her feet ripples outward in concentric circles as if she is vibrating at a frequency below perception. Her bare feet are just visible beneath the kimono hem, standing on the water surface not in it. The single working light above her head buzzes and flickers, each flash showing her in a slightly different position though she appears not to have moved. The tunnel around her is darker than it should be as if the darkness is emanating from her. Foreground: rippling water extending from where she stands toward the viewer.

The reflection does not match reality. The real world above the puddle is normal overcast daylight. The reflected world in the water is the dark fluorescent tunnel with the entity.
