  "defaults": {
    "characterLock": "Same character as the attached image (Nova). Keep face, horns, eyes, outfit, and identity consistent. Keep the same voice tone across scenes.",
    "negatives": "No landscapes. No nature scenes. No volcano/lava. No aerial shots. No random objects. No text-heavy UI. No clutter.",

    {
      "scene": "Nova speaks to camera in a modern studio. Subtle ember glow. A small, tasteful lobster icon appears on a holographic panel behind her.",

      "how": "calm, intelligent, intimate."

      "scene": "A minimal diagram fades in: Tools → Skills → Automations. A small lobster silhouette sits near the word ‘Skills’.",
      "say": "OpenClaw isn’t a chatbot. It’s tools, skills, and automation—wired together to actually do work.",
      "how": "measured, confident."

      "scene": "Holographic cards labeled: Browser, Web Search, Files, Processes. Nova gestures softly; cards align neatly.",

      "how": "clear, thoughtful."
    },
    {
      "scene": "A ‘Skill’ book motif opens, showing checklists. A small lobster charm dangles from the corner like a keychain.",
      "say": "Skills are playbooks. They encode the exact steps—so the agent is repeatable, not random.",
      "how": "quiet certainty."
    },
    {
      "scene": "A timeline shows a nightly run: discovery → transcript → rank → notes. The lobster icon highlights ‘rank’.",
      "say": "We use it to discover what matters, capture transcripts, rank signal, and save it into our knowledge base.",
      "how": "calm, practical."
    },
    {
      "scene": "A ‘Video’ pipeline appears: prompt → generate → chain frames → final cut. Lobster icon sits beside ‘chain frames’.",
      "say": "We even automate creative work—multi-scene video generation with consistent characters, end to end.",
      "how": "confident, understated."
    },
    {
      "scene": "A dashboard: ‘Reliability’ with green checks: bounded timeouts, retries, logs. A lobster stamp marks ‘approved’.",
      "say": "The difference is discipline: bounded timeouts, logs, retries. Automation you can run every day.",
      "how": "steady, reassuring."
    },
    {
      "scene": "Nova leans in slightly. Minimal text appears: ‘Your business, less chaos’. Lobster icon is subtle in corner.",

      "how": "intimate, founder-to-founder."

      "scene": "A clean end-to-end flow: Lead → Reply → Follow-up → Booked call → Delivered. Lobster icon nods like a mascot.",
      "say": "You don’t need more apps. You need one agentic system that keeps the loop closed.",
      "how": "smart, calm close."
    },
    {
      "scene": "End card: Business Builders • Nova • Built on OpenClaw. A small lobster emblem sits next to OpenClaw.",
